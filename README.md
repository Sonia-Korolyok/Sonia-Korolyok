## Hi there 👋 I'm Sonia

🎓 I'm currently studying full-stack development.  
💻 Right now I'm focusing on the front-end — learning JS, React, TypeScript, RTK, and Firebase.  
🛠️ Soon diving into back-end development with Node.js and databases.

🎯 My goal is to become a confident full-stack developer and enjoy building cool and useful apps.
